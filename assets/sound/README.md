# Sounds

The sounds here have been replaced with empty files. Originally these were pulled from Minecrafts soundtrack and game files directly to create the experience. To avoid redistributing materials without proper licensing, I have removed them from the project.

To workaround this, the files can be copied back in (in the `.wav` format) or alternative media can be used for this.
